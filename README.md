## Project Overview
The goal of this project is to better understand what influences the price of accommodations on Airbnb using Seattle Airbnb data. 
To be more specific, the data was leveraged to answer the following questions:

- How does price vary with different types of properties?
- How do review scores affect the price?
- How does price fluctuate over different months?

To achieve the goal, data wrangling and exploratory data analysis were performed on the dataset.

## File Descriptions
The notebook (.ipynb) showcases the work carried out to answer the questions above.

There is an additional .html file that has the same exact thing as the .ipynb file. This file is created for the 
convenience of people who would like to view the work in the browser instead of using an IDE.
